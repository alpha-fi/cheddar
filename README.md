# Cheddar Network


Cheddar Network is the leading ecosystem for NEAR dapps. Our mission is to be grow the NEAR Dapp landscape by creating a common farming mechanism and funding new projects.


## Cheddar Defi Farm

A Defi token and farm on NEAR. Cheddar is a fun way for NEAR users to collect, swap and send Cheddar. To get Cheddar you can swap NEAR and stake it in the farm to stack even more Cheddar. Cheddar will also include a DAO (Phase II) where users can lock Cheddar to receive governance tokens to participate in the development process while earning additional rewards.
